            <p> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Education is an all-encompassing word. It’s not just confined to books and degrees.
                The real objective of
                education is to emancipate an individual and blossom his/ her personality to the fullest. <br>
                ‘Education liberates’, Carl Marx’s pithy comment upon the exact function of education underlines its
                enormous role in the life of a person. <br>
                If one’s educated, one’s liberated. Education liberates a person
                from all pettiness and prejudices that pull all of us down. Education makes one aware of his / her
                potential and it nurtures and nourishes the immense possibilities an individual’s endowed with. <br>
                A child is a ‘rough diamond’. Proper education hones the facets of this ‘rough diamond’ and makes it
                ‘Kohinoor’, ‘Cullinan’ or ‘Sancy’, three of the greatest diamonds.</p>
